## About

Virtual-Mute is a small and simple accessability utility desktop app.

You can set custom shortcuts in the UI to easily trigger them from the GUI

*Settings Icon > Add Shortcute*

 - The first field is the key
 - The Second is a checkBox for Ctrl 
 - The Third is a checkBox for Shift 

You'll need to set up your shortcut of choice in the platform.

e.g Discord : Settings > Keybinds set the action to Toggle Mute and Keybind the same as the one you set up in Virtual-Mute
